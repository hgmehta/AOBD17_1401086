# Career Path Recommendation System

This project is about suggesting a career path to user. Project is divided into two modules. In first module we need to read a user's profile and based on the profile suggest a career path. In Second Module, user gives an input as a career goal and based on his/her career goal we suggests a career path. 

## Getting Started

The code is written in c# language and training data is in JSON format. Code is available in Implementation folder and data is in "Implementation\JobRecommendation\JobRecommendation\Data.txt" folder

### Prerequisites

To run a c# code you need Visual Studio or other IDE which can complile and run c# program. To read JSON file I used Newtonsoft JSON framework in Visual Studio 2015.
To install Newtonsoft JSON in visual studio 2015 goto Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console Write following command in console
```
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
```

## Running the tests

Program.cs file contains the main function of a program. Parser.cs file contains the function which help you to read a json file.
